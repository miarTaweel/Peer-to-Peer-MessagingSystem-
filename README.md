# Peer-to-Peer Network Messaging System  

This **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network Messaging System** is a **Python-based** application that enables direct communication between devices on the **same local network** without requiring internet access.  

The system uses **broadcast IP** to allow devices to discover and exchange messages dynamically. Since the program runs from a **single Python script**, it is easy to deploy on multiple devices.  

## **Features**  

✔ **Single Script Deployment** – A single file runs on all devices, simplifying setup.  
✔ **Local Network Communication** – Messages are exchanged via broadcast without internet.  
✔ **Peer Discovery** – Devices can detect each other dynamically using the broadcast IP.  
✔ **Real-time Messaging** – Users can send and receive messages instantly.  
✔ **Lightweight & Fast** – Uses minimal resources, making it efficient for embedded or low-power devices.  


## **How It Works**  

1. **Users enter the broadcast IP of their network in the python code** (e.g., `192.188.1.255`).  
2. **After Compillation the script listens and can send messages** from any device on the network.  
3. **Messages are broadcasted to all devices** running the script.  
4. **Each device displays incoming messages** in real-time.
